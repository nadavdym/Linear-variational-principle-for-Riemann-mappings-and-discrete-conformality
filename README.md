Example Matlab script for computing riemann mapping from a triangulated polygonal
domain to a triangle, based on the method described in [1,2]. Input is a planar mesh and 3 boundary points given
in counter clockwise orientation. Code was written by Nadav Dym and Raz Slutsky, heavily based on previous code by Noam Aigerman. Inquiries about the code can be sent to

 Conformality" Dym, Lipman, Slutsky
